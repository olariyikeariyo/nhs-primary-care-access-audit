# uk-emergency-admissions-prevention-analysis

## Overview
This project examines avoidable emergency admissions across England with a focus on conditions that should be manageable through effective primary and community care.  
The analysis supports commissioners and system leaders in targeting prevention activity to reduce emergency pressure and cost.

## Problem Statement
Emergency admissions place sustained pressure on NHS capacity and finances. A significant proportion are classified as avoidable yet rates vary widely across regions indicating inconsistent prevention effectiveness. Without clear insight into where and why avoidable admissions occur investment decisions remain reactive leading to higher costs poorer outcomes and increased service strain.

## Stakeholders
- NHS England / ICS leadership
- Trust operational teams
- Commissioners
- Patients and public

## Key Questions
- Which conditions drive the highest volume of avoidable emergency admissions?
- How do admission rates vary by region and GP practice?
- What is the estimated cost and capacity impact of reducing avoidable admissions?
